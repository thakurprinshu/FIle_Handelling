📂 Java File Handling Repository

This repository contains multiple Java programs demonstrating File Handling concepts in Java.
It covers basic to advanced operations such as reading, writing, copying, merging, reversing contents, 
and applying OOP + SOLID principles for a real-world Policy Management System.

Read from console and write to a file
Read and display file contents
Count characters in a file
Reverse file contents
Copy contents from one file to another

🔹 Policy Management System (OOP + SOLID)

Encapsulation: Policy class encapsulates policy data
Abstraction: Policy_Manager abstracts file operations
Interface & DIP: File_Handler interface ensures flexibility
SRP: Each class has a single responsibility
OCP: Easily extendable to support new file formats

🛠️ Technologies Used
